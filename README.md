A Rigorously Tested, Modern, Opinionated Multicall Library


**‚ö†Ô∏è Depreciation Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è**
-------------------------
-------------------------

This Repository is not maintained and is only used as a Proof-of-Concept for [Multicall3](https://github.com/mds1/multicall) as part of [Matt Solomon](https://github.com/mds1)'s maintained [multicall repository](https://github.com/mds1/multicall).

[mds1/multicall](https://github.com/mds1/multicall) is an actively maintained fork from MakerDAO's inactive [multicall repository](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall).

-------------------------

## Overview

Adapted from Makerdao's [`multicall`](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall), this library provides a simple way to call multiple contracts at once.

Built with [`foundry`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry), parcels is rigorously tested and maintained.

## Development

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).


#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```
